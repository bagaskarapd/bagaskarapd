I am a recent Informatics Engineering graduate with a strong interest in cybersecurity. My hands-on experience in TryHackMe labs and Cisco Networking Academy courses have shaped my passion for digital defense. I am currently seeking to grow my career as a Tier 1 SOC Analyst and use this portfolio to showcase my skills and continuous learning.

## Objective

My journey in Informatic Engineering has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
